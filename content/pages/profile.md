# Research Experience

## 2016-2018

**Researcher at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST)**<br>
*Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan*<br>

I served as a laboratory assistant in Iida laboratory with a focus on doing research in serious games domain.  The aim of my research is to optimize the use of game elements in serious environments especially education. I have analyzed and evaluated the entertainment aspect of gamification based on the Game Refinement Theory. The research results were written in LATEX as research papers and published in international conferences.

#### Understanding the Effects of Game in Educational Environment using Game Refinement Measure - MAIN RESEARCH PROJECT

In this project, we focused on analyzing the use of gamification in the most popular language learning platform DUOLINGO. By using Game refinement theory as a fundamental theory, we recognized and explained some useful facts which are used by the Duolingo authors for attracting the users while they are studying. We also apply our research to analyze and improve the attractiveness of our own training game. The result of that application is good and reasonable.
#### Cybersecurity Awareness Training Game Design(CAT) - MINOR RESEARCH PROJECT

The project aims at designing a training tool for a student in our campus which helps newcomers can understand the concept of cybersecurity while playing a game. The idea of this research is giving a player real cybersecurity attack cases in a daily life and let them choose theirs react for each case. After that, the game will evaluate their react and explain to them the situation and the real answer.  The game is rated well on the aspect of understanding cybersecurity problems and solutions by the players.
