Yesterday is the graduation day of my school (JAIST). It really a nice day for my seniors to get their graduated certificate. I can see the satisfaction on their face. Someone will be continuing their PhD degree, but someone will find a job in Japan and start their ‘busy’ life. Although their future-goal are different, they are really happy when getting the achievements for their efforts after 2 years far away from home.

Student life away from home does not easy to pass. You have to face a lot of difficulties in a daily life such as the homesickness, living cost,  relationship problems, etc. However, those things will give you unforgettable memories and good experiences for you in the future. Similarly, my seniors also paid a lot of efforts for their degree at JAIST and finally they leave JAIST with their pride. In the life, there are some friends who can make you happy, angry, or sad. However, if you no longer meet them, you will feel empty.  Now I am a second year master student that means I will graduate in the next year and I am wondering that “What I need to prepare for my graduation and for my career?”, there are a lot of messy things in my mind.
