## What is Git Hooks

Git-hooks is a way to fire off a custom script when certain important occur

There are two groups of hooks:
1. Client-side hooks:
	* Hooks for some actions on client side such as commit, merge, push, rebase, etc.
2. Server-side hooks:
	* Hooks for some actions on server side such as update, receive, etc. which were called when there a commit from client pushing

## Installing a hook

* Hooks of git are located by default in `path_to_project/.git/hooks`
* We can change hook path via `core.hooksPath` configuration variable [(see)](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
* Basically, we use shell script for a hook but it can be written by any execute script such as Python
```python
 #!/usr/bin/env python
```

* In the `.git/hooks` folder, there are some samples which we can used directly by copying and removing `.sample` extension.
```bash 
mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
* Or we can create our own new file using vim command.<br>
	_Note that: a file name must same as hook name_
```bash
vim .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

## Client-side hooks

* There many kinds of client-side hooks, so we will group it by workflow :
	1. Committing-workflow hooks
	2. Email-workflow hooks
	3. Other client hooks
* All hooks will return 0 for continuing the current action or > 0 for abort the current action

### Committing workflow hooks

* __pre-commit__: 
	* Invoked by __git commit__ (before making a commit)
	* It can be bypassed with _--no-verify_ option
	* No param
	* This hook is used to checking code format, run test, etc.
* __prepare-commit-message__:
	* Invoked by __git commit__ (after creating default message but before editor started)
	* It can be bypassed with _--no-verify_ option
	* 3 params
		1. Name of file that contains commit log message 
		2. Source of the commit message
		3. Can be: message (if _-m_), template (if _-t_), merge, squash or commit (if _-c_, _-C_ , or _--amend_)
* __commit-msg__: 
	* Invoked by git commit and __git merge__ (after editing a commit message)
	* It can be bypassed with _--no-verify_ option
	* 1 param: Name of file that contains commit log message 
	* This hook is used to normalize the message into some project standard format
* __post-commit__:
	* Invoked by __git commit__ (after a commit is made)
	* Do not make any effect on commit process
	* No param

### Email workflow hooks

* __applypatch-msg__: 
	* Invoked by __git am__ (before applying patch)
	* It is allowed to edit message file in place
	* 1 param: Name of file that hold proposed commit log message 
* __pre-applypatch__: 
	* Invoked by __git am__ (after applying patch before a commit is made)
	* Similar to __pre-commit__
	* No param
* __post-applypatch__: â€‹
	* Invoked by __git am__ (after applying patch and a commit is made)
	* No param

### Other client hooks

* __pre-rebase__: 
	* Called by __git rebase__ (before rebase do a change)
	* Can be used to prevent a branch from getting rebased
	* 1 or 2 params:
		1. The upstream from which the series was forked
		2. The branch being rebased. It is not set when rebasing the current branch.
* __post-checkout__: 
	* Invoked by __git checkout__ or git switch (after having updated work tree)
	* Cannot affect the outcome of git actions
	* 3 params:
		1. The ref of the previous HEAD
		2. The ref of the new HEAD
		3. Flag which indicating whether it  was a branch checkout
* __post-merge__: 
	* Invoked by __git merge__ (after git pull is done on local repo)
	* Cannot affect outcome of git action
	* 1 param:  a status flag specifying whether or not the merge being done was a squash merge
* __pre-push__: 
	* Called by __git push__
	* Can be used to prevent the push from taking place
	* 2 params: 
		1. Name and location of the destination remote
		2. Both above params are same if a named remote is not being used

## Server-side hooks

* Those hooks can be used to enforce nearly any kind of policy for project
* These scrips run before and after pushes to server
* Hooks return non-zero at any time to reject the push as well as print a error message
* There many hooks on server side but I just mention 3 popular hooks which are pre-receive, update, and post-receive

* __pre-receive__:
	* Invoked by __git receive pack__ which react to git push from client (before starting update refs)
	* Executes one for the receive operation
	* It takes a list of references that are being pushed from stdin
* __update__:
	* Invoked by __git receive pack__ (before update refs) 
	* Similar to pre-received but it run once for each branch ( push to multiple branches)
	* 3 params:
		1. The name of ref being updated
		2. The old object name stored in ref
		3. The new object name stored in ref
* __post-receive__:
	* Invoked by __git receive pack__ (after all refs be updated)
	* No param but gets the same information as the __pre-receive__

## Example

* __Requirement__<br>
	As PM I want to lock some branches which are already released to avoid activities in those (wrong commit, force commit, etc.)  
* __Solution__<br>
	We will use an __update__ hook for checking the name of pushed branch. If the branch is in the list of locked branches or has a suffix `_released` then it will be rejected to update.
* __Practices__
	1. Create a new hook in `path_to_project/.git/hooks`
	```bash
	#Connect to git server
	ssh user@gitserver.com
	#Work as an admin
	su - 
	#Create or edit an update hook
	vim /path_to_your_project/.git/hook/update
	```

	2. Edit an update hook as follows:
	```bash
	#!/bin/sh
	# list of locked branches
	declare -a lockedbranches=("lockedBranch" "githooktest" "deadbranch")
	pushedbranch="$1"
	oldname="$2"
	# Accept the creation
	if [[ $oldname == "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" ]]
	then
			exit 0
	fi
	# If branch exist then check whether it is locked
	for locked in "${lockedbranches[@]}"
	do
			path="refs/heads/${locked}"
			# reject branch in the list or endwith _released
			if [[ $pushedbranch == $path || $pushedbranch == *"_released" ]]
			then
					echo "NOTICE: You cannot push to ${pushedbranch}."
					echo "NOTICE: It is a locked branch."
					exit 1
			fi
	done
	exit 0
	```

	3. Save a hook file and set a execute permission to it.
	```bash	
	chmod +x /path_to_your_project/.git/hook/update
	```

	4. Test it by pushing a branch in locked list
	```bash
	git push -u origin lockedBranch
	``` 
	An output will be:
	```bash
	Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
	remote: NOTICE: You cannot push to lockedBranch.
	remote: NOTICE: It is a locked branch.
	remote: error: hook declined to update refs/heads/lockedBranch
	```
* __Discussion__
	* The push will be accepted if pushed branch does not exist
	* From the second time, it will be rejected in below cases:
	```bash		
	#Normal push on locked branch (current branch is lockedBranch) 
	git push 
	#Push and create remote branch
	git push --set-upstream origin lockedBranch
	#Push other branch
	git push origin lockedBranch
	git push origin lockedBranch:lockedBranch
	#Override local branch to locked remote branch
	git push origin newBranch:lockedBranch
	#Branch has name end with _released
	git push -u origin newBranch_released
	```
